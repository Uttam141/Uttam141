## üöÄ About Me

I'm a mechatronics engineer who loves building things that move, think, and solve real problems. Currently working at **Nosh Robotics** in Bengaluru, developing embedded systems for robotic applications.

This portfolio is where I share the projects I've worked on, the things I've learned, and hopefully, what makes me excited about engineering.

```python
class Uttam:
    def __init__(self):
        self.role = " R&D Engineer"
        self.location = "Hyderabad, India"
        self.interests = ["Robotics", "AI/ML", "IoT", "Control Systems"]
        self.current_focus = "Building intelligent autonomous systems"
    
    def say_hi(self):
        print("Thanks for stopping by! Let's build something amazing together.")
```

## üíº What I Work On

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### ü§ñ Robotics & Hardware
Building physical systems that interact with the world. From underwater robots that competed internationally to 3D-printed grippers that can handle delicate objects.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### üß† AI & Machine Learning
Teaching computers to recognize patterns and make predictions. I've built chatbots, analyzed climate data, and created models for environmental monitoring.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### ‚ö° Embedded Systems & IoT
Making devices smarter and connected. Whether it's a training system for kids with special needs or motor controllers that provide real-time feedback.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### üíª Software Development
Apps and web tools that bring it all together. Because hardware is only half the story.

## üéØ Featured Projects

<details open>
<summary><b>üè• Training Kit for Kids with ASD</b> <i>(2025)</i></summary>
<br>

Built a resistive pedal trainer that therapists can monitor and adjust remotely. Uses **ESP32** and **Raspberry Pi 4** to track progress and provide feedback. It's rewarding work that actually helps people.

**Tech Stack:** `ESP32` `Raspberry Pi` `IoT` `Control Systems`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üåä Autonomous Underwater Vehicle</b> <i>(2023-2025)</i></summary>
<br>

Spent two years with a team building an autonomous underwater vehicle. We competed in **Abu Dhabi** and **placed 4th globally** üèÜ. Lots of late nights debugging control systems, but totally worth it.

**Tech Stack:** `ROS2` `Python` `Computer Vision` `SLAM`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üó∫Ô∏è ROS2 Robot with LiDAR Mapping</b> <i>(2024)</i></summary>
<br>

Created a three-wheeled bot that can map its environment and navigate autonomously. It's basically a smaller, friendlier version of what goes into self-driving cars.

**Tech Stack:** `ROS2` `LiDAR` `Python` `Navigation`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>üå§Ô∏è Climate Pattern Analysis</b> <i>(2024)</i></summary>
<br>

Used **K-Means clustering** to find patterns in weather data. Sometimes the best insights come from letting algorithms do what they do best.

**Tech Stack:** `Python` `scikit-learn` `Data Analysis` `Visualization`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>ü¶æ 3D-Printed Soft Gripper</b> <i>(2023)</i></summary>
<br>

Designed and 3D-printed a gripper that's gentle enough for fragile objects. It's inspired by soft robotics research and made with accessible FDM printing.

**Tech Stack:** `Fusion 360` `3D Printing` `Soft Robotics` `CAD`
